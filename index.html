      <h3>What is this?</h3>
      <p>This is a classic hand game where you compete against the computer. Choose Rock, Paper, or Scissorsâ€”each beats one and loses to another:
        <ul>
          <li>Rock crushes Scissors</li>
          <li>Scissors cuts Paper</li>
          <li>Paper covers Rock</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      <h3>How to play?</h3>
      <p>To play Rock-Paper-Scissors, choose one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Your opponent (either a friend or the computer) will also pick one. The winner is decided based on these simple rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. If both players choose the same option, it's a tie. Keep playing and see how many rounds you can win!</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you choose Rock, you will win against Scissors but lose against Paper.</li>
          <li>If you choose Scissors, you will win against Paper but lose against Rock.</li>
          <li>If you choose Paper, you will win against Rock but lose against Scissors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There can be 3 to 5 rounds. The game ends when somebody gets 3 wins.</p>
